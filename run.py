"""
This script implements a simplified version of the board game "Can't Stop"
for two players. The game is played using a Google Sheets worksheet as the
game board. The players take turns rolling dice, choosing combinations, and
moving their pieces on the board. The first player to reach a winning
coordinate is declared the winner.
